## Load Balancing

- **Definition**: A Load Balancer (LB) is a critical component in distributed systems that distributes incoming network and application traffic across multiple servers.

- **Purpose**:

  - Enhances responsiveness and availability of applications, websites, or databases.
  - Prevents overloading any single server, thus avoiding single points of failure.

- **Placement**:

  - Between the user and the web server.
  - Between web servers and internal platform layers (e.g., application servers, cache servers).
  - Between internal platform layers and databases.

- **Benefits**:

  - Provides faster, uninterrupted service to users.
  - Increases overall system throughput and decreases downtime.
  - Facilitates management of incoming requests and reduces wait times.
  - Smart LBs offer predictive analytics for traffic management and decision support.

- **Load Balancing Algorithms**:

  - **Least Connection Method**: Directs traffic to the server with the fewest active connections.
  - **Least Response Time Method**: Chooses the server with the fewest connections and the lowest response time.
  - **Least Bandwidth Method**: Selects the server using the least amount of bandwidth.
  - **Round Robin Method**: Distributes requests cyclically among servers of equal specifications.
  - **Weighted Round Robin**: Similar to Round Robin but considers server processing capacity.
  - **IP Hash**: Assigns requests based on a hash of the client's IP address.

- **Health Checks**:

  - Ensures traffic is only sent to operational ("healthy") servers.
  - Automatically removes and reinstates servers from the pool based on their response to health checks.

- **Redundancy**:
  - To prevent LBs from becoming single points of failure, redundant LBs can be used, where each monitors the health and performance of the other. -<img width="376" alt="Screenshot 2024-05-13 at 1 08 06 AM" src="https://github.com/KadamJay/DesignPreparation/assets/106463391/ed48930f-e825-4661-8e7b-75629f9c42b1">
