## Scalability

- **Definition**: Scalability is a system's ability to grow and handle increased demand effectively.
- **Reasons to Scale**: Increased data volume or work, such as a higher number of transactions.
- **Challenges**: Performance may decline as the system expands due to management costs or physical limitations, such as slower network speeds or indivisible tasks.
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Involves adding more servers to a resource pool, facilitating dynamic growth without downtime.
- **Vertical Scaling**: Involves enhancing an existing server with more CPU, RAM, or Storage, typically limited by the server's capacity and often requires downtime for upgrades.
- **Examples**:

  - **Horizontal**: Cassandra and MongoDB scale by adding more servers.
  - **Vertical**: MySQL scales by upgrading to more powerful hardware, usually with downtime.

## Reliability

- **Definition**: Reliability is the ability of a system to continue operating correctly in the presence of faults, errors, or failures.
- **Key Concept**: A reliable system maintains service continuity even if components fail, often through redundancy of software and data.
- **Example**: In an e-commerce store like Amazon, if a server handling a shopping cart fails, another server with a replica takes over, ensuring no transaction is lost.

## Availability

- **Definition**: Availability measures the time a system is operational and capable of performing its required functions within a specified period.
- **Considerations**: Includes maintainability, repair times, spare parts availability, and logistical aspects.
- **Reliability vs. Availability**: High reliability contributes to high availability, but systems can achieve high availability through fast repairs and good spare management even if they are not highly reliable.

## Efficiency

- **Measures**:
  - **Response Time (Latency)**: Time delay to receive the first result.
  - **Throughput (Bandwidth)**: Number of items delivered per unit time.
- **Cost Units**:
  - **Number of Messages**: Total messages sent by the system's nodes.
  - **Size of Messages**: Data volume exchanged.
- **Challenges**: Developing accurate cost models is complex due to factors like network load, component heterogeneity, and system architecture.

## Serviceability or Manageability

- **Definition**: The ease and speed with which a system can be maintained or repaired.
- **Importance**: Faster maintenance increases system availability.
- **Features**:
  - **Diagnostic Simplicity**: Ease of diagnosing and understanding issues.
  - **Update and Modification Ease**: How readily the system can be updated or modified.
  - **Operational Simplicity**: The system's ability to operate routinely without failures.
- **Example**: Some enterprise systems automatically contact service centers when faults occur, reducing downtime.
