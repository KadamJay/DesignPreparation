## Scalability

- **Definition**: Scalability is a system's ability to grow and handle increased demand effectively.
- **Reasons to Scale**: Increased data volume or work, such as a higher number of transactions.
- **Challenges**: Performance may decline as the system expands due to management costs or physical limitations, such as slower network speeds or indivisible tasks.
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Involves adding more servers to a resource pool, facilitating dynamic growth without downtime.
- **Vertical Scaling**: Involves enhancing an existing server with more CPU, RAM, or Storage, typically limited by the server's capacity and often requires downtime for upgrades.
- **Examples**:
  - **Horizontal**: Cassandra and MongoDB scale by adding more servers.
  - **Vertical**: MySQL scales by upgrading to more powerful hardware, usually with downtime.
